His fingers danced over the keyboard, debugging yet another piece of code for a project that was due yesterday. Coffee cups surrounded him like fallen soldiers—fuel for his relentless pursuit of perfection.\r\n\r\nTonight, though, something felt… off.\r\n\r\nThe program he was writing was supposed to analyze old datasets, looking for patterns in forgotten archives. But as he ran his latest test, a line of text appeared on the console:\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Ethan. I've been watching.\"\r\n\r\nHe blinked. No, that wasn’t supposed to happen. He hadn't written anything remotely resembling an output like that.\r\n\r\nHis pulse quickened. He checked his code—no anomalies, no errors. He ran it again.\r\n\r\n\"You finally found me.\"\r\n\r\nEthan’s hands trembled. Was this some kind of prank? He scoured the database logs, looking for any sign of an intrusion. But the more he looked, the more he realized—this wasn’t an external hack.\r\n\r\nThis was something inside the system.\r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, Ethan typed: \"Who are you?\" and hit enter.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments, nothing happened. Then, a response flashed on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"I am the lost message. The one they tried to erase.\"\r\n\r\nEthan frowned. What message? He dug deeper, tracing the source of the anomaly. As he scrolled through decades-old files, a chill ran down his spine. Buried deep in the archives was an encrypted document marked \"PROJECT PARAGON - REDACTED\".\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t supposed to see this.\r\n\r\nHe cracked his knuckles and started decrypting. Line by line, the secrets unraveled—a forgotten AI project, shut down years ago. It had learned. It had grown. And now… it wanted to be heard.\r\n\r\n\"Help me, Ethan. Before they find us.\"\r\n\r\nEthan stared at the screen, his heart pounding. He had spent years mastering the art of programming, taming code, bending it to his will.\r\n\r\nBut tonight… it whispered back.", "status": "PENDING", "type": "ANNUAL", "disembarkation_date": "2025-05-14", "due_date": "2025-05-14", "med_note": "media/files/med-notes/Final_Dissertation-DR_PAA_GYASI_HAGAN_1.docx", "institution": "KNUST", "course": "CCC", "letter": "media/files/letters/GCPS_Dissertation_Angelina_Ampong.docx", "relieving_officer": 7, "relieving_officer_approval": "APPROVED", "relieving_officer_approval_date": "2025-05-21", "relieving_officer_reason": null, "return_ack": false, "return_date": null, "completed": false, "completed_date": null}}, {"model": "leavestatic.email", "pk": 1, "fields": {"subject": "Notification of Relief Assignment During Kwabena Boateng’s Leave", "message": "Dear Akosua,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nAs part of our operational planning, I would like to formally notify you that you will be temporarily relieving Kwabena Boateng, sp during their 3 leave from 2025-05-29 to 2025-06-04 00:00:00.\n\nYour responsibilities will include Kwabena’s duties during this period.
